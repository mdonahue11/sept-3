<p>  five steps to decorating your home 


<p> <b>If you want your house to make a great first impression, paint the front door a fun, glossy hue.</b> <i>"Red is a lucky color in many cultures,"</i> says Lara Allen-Brett, a New Jersey-based stager. <br>A red door meant <i>"welcome"</i> to weary travelers in early America, and on churches it represents a safe haven. Two other hues gaining favor: orange and yellow, according to San Francisco-based stager Christopher Breining. Both colors are associated with joy and warmth. One thing that should go: an outdated screen door. Get rid of it or replace it with a storm door with full-length glass that you can switch out for a screened panel.<p>
